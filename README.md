# Python Fundamentals

This repository contains my Python fundamentals practice, focused on building a solid foundation in programming logic, data structures, and problem-solving.

The exercises and mini-projects were developed during my studies and reflect hands-on practice of core Python concepts commonly expected for junior-level roles. The focus is on clarity, consistency, and gradual progression in complexity.

- Comprehensions combined with `map`, `filter`, `zip`, `all`, and `any`

### logic_practice/
- Logic exercises
- Problem-solving with conditionals and loops

### projects/

#### 📌 Student Grades Calculator (CLI)
- Collects student names and exam grades via user input
- Calculates average grades using `map`
- Filters approved students using `filter`
- Displays approval messages based on results
- Focus on functional programming and clean data processing

#### 📌 Lead Pre-Qualification (CLI)
- Simulates a simple lead qualification flow
- Validates user input (name, age, income)
- Classifies leads based on predefined rules
- Generates user-friendly messages
- Focus on logic, validation, and decision flow

#### 📌 Expense Tracker (CLI)
- Collects expense descriptions and values via user input
- Validates inputs using `while` loops and `try/except`
- Stores data as tuples
- Filters expenses above a threshold
- Calculates totals using `map`, `filter`, and `sum`
- Focus on error handling, functions, and data organization

#### 📌 File Analyzer (CLI)
- Reads a text file provided by the user
- Counts total characters and total lines
- Handles file errors using `try/except`
- Uses functions to separate logic from user interaction
- Focus on file handling, error handling, and clean function design

## Goals

- Strengthen Python fundamentals
- Improve logical reasoning through structured exercises
- Practice writing clear, readable, and maintainable code
- Apply functional programming tools to real problems
- Build confidence before moving on to advanced topics

## Notes

- This repository focuses on **fundamentals**, not advanced abstractions
- Code prioritizes readability and explicit logic over optimization
- Projects are built incrementally using only concepts already studied
