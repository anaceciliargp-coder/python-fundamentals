# Python Fundamentals

This repository contains my Python fundamentals practice, focused on building a solid foundation in programming logic, data structures, and problem-solving.

The exercises were developed during my studies and reflect hands-on practice of core Python concepts commonly expected for junior-level roles. The goal is clarity, consistency, and gradual progression in complexity.

## Repository Structure

- **basics/**
  - Variables
  - Input and output
  - Conditionals (`if / elif / else`)
  - Loops (`for / while`)

- **collections/**
  - Lists
  - Tuples
  - Dictionaries
  - Sets
  - `collections` module (`Counter`, `defaultdict`)

- **functions/**
  - Function definitions
  - Return values
  - Parameters and default parameters
  - `*args` and `**kwargs`
  - Functions with lists and dictionaries

- **logic_practice/**
  - Logic exercises
  - Vectors and matrices
  - Problem-solving using loops and conditionals

## Goals

- Strengthen Python fundamentals
- Improve logical reasoning through structured exercises
- Practice writing clear, readable, and maintainable code
- Build consistency before moving on to more advanced topics and frameworks

## Notes

- This repository focuses on **fundamentals**, not advanced or “clever” solutions
- Code prioritizes readability over optimization
- Some files include simple execution examples for learning and testing purposes

## Status

This repository is a **work in progress** and is continuously updated as I progress in my Python studies.
