# Python Fundamentals

This repository contains my Python fundamentals practice, focused on building a solid foundation in programming logic, data structures, and problem-solving.

The exercises and mini-projects were developed during my studies and reflect hands-on practice of core Python concepts commonly expected for junior-level roles. The focus is on clarity, consistency, and gradual progression in complexity.

## Repository Structure

### basics/
- Variables  
- Input and output  
- Conditionals (`if / elif / else`)  
- Loops (`for / while`)  

### collections/
- Lists  
- Tuples  
- Dictionaries  
- Sets  
- `collections` module (`Counter`, `defaultdict`)  

### functions/
- Function definitions  
- Return values  
- Parameters and default parameters  
- Functions with lists and dictionaries  

### comprehensions/
- List comprehensions  
- Dictionary comprehensions  
- Set comprehensions  
- Comprehensions combined with functions and data structures  

### logic_practice/
- Logic exercises  
- Problem-solving using loops and conditionals  

### projects/
Mini projects created to practice multiple concepts together in realistic scenarios.

- **lead_prequalification_cli/**
  - Command-line program that simulates a lead pre-qualification flow
  - Collects user input (name, age, monthly income)
  - Validates data using basic control flow and `try / except`
  - Classifies leads (invalid / basic / qualified)
  - Generates appropriate messages for each lead type
  - Focuses on fundamentals without external APIs or AI

- **student_grades_cli/**
  - Command-line program that collects student names and exam grades
  - Uses `zip()` to combine related data
  - Applies `map()` to calculate averages
  - Uses `filter()` to select approved students
  - Generates result messages based on calculated averages

## Goals

- Strengthen Python fundamentals  
- Improve logical reasoning through structured exercises  
- Practice writing clear, readable, and maintainable code  
- Learn to combine built-in functions (`map`, `filter`, `zip`) effectively  
- Build confidence before moving on to more advanced topics and frameworks

## Notes

- This repository focuses on **fundamentals**, not advanced or “clever” solutions  
- Code prioritizes readability and explicit logic over optimization  
- Mini-projects are intentionally simple and CLI-based  
- No external libraries or frameworks are used unless explicitly required

## Status

This repository is a **work in progress** and is continuously updated as I progress in my Python studies.
