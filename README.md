# Python Fundamentals

This repository contains my Python fundamentals practice, focused on building a **strong and practical foundation** in programming logic, data structures, and problem-solving using Python.

The exercises and small projects were developed during my studies and reflect **hands-on practice** of core Python concepts commonly expected for **junior / entry-level roles**.  
The emphasis is on **clarity, explicit logic, and gradual progression in complexity**.

## Repository Structure

### **basics/**
- Variables  
- Input and output  
- Conditionals (`if / elif / else`)  
- Loops (`for / while`)  

---

### **collections/**
- Lists  
- Tuples  
- Dictionaries  
- Sets  
- `collections` module (`Counter`, `defaultdict`)  

---

### **functions/**
- Function definitions  
- Return values  
- Parameters and default parameters  
- `*args` and `**kwargs`  
- Functions working with lists and dictionaries  

---

### **comprehensions/**
- List comprehensions  
- Dictionary comprehensions  
- Set comprehensions  
- Comprehensions combined with conditionals and data structures  
- Exercises focused on readability and logical understanding  

---

### **logic_practice/**
- Logic exercises  
- Vectors and matrices  
- Problem-solving using loops and conditionals  

---

### **lead-prequalification-cli/**
A small **command-line mini project** simulating a **lead pre-qualification flow**, built using only Python fundamentals.

**Concepts applied:**
- User input handling  
- Data validation  
- Conditional logic  
- Functions and return values  
- Simple business rules  
- Clean and readable control flow  

**What the program does:**
- Collects basic lead information (name, age, monthly income)  
- Validates user input  
- Allows the user to confirm or re-enter their information  
- Classifies the lead as:
  - `Invalid`
  - `Basic`
  - `Qualified`
- Generates an appropriate message based on the classification  

This project was intentionally built **without frameworks, external APIs, or advanced techniques**, focusing purely on **logic and fundamentals**, making it suitable as an early portfolio project.

## Goals

- Strengthen Python fundamentals  
- Improve logical reasoning through structured exercises  
- Practice writing **clear, readable, and maintainable code**  
- Learn to apply comprehensions for cleaner and more expressive solutions  
- Translate learning into **small practical projects**  
- Build consistency before moving on to more advanced topics and frameworks  

---

## Notes

- This repository focuses on **fundamentals**, not advanced or “clever” solutions  
- Code prioritizes **readability and explicit logic** over optimization  
- Comprehension examples are written in a **didactic and easy-to-follow way**  
- Mini projects are intentionally simple and incremental  
- Some files include basic execution examples for learning and testing purposes

## Status

This repository is a **work in progress** and is continuously updated as I progress in my Python studies and expand my understanding of software development concepts.
