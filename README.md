# Python Fundamentals

This repository contains my Python fundamentals practice, focused on building a strong base in programming logic, data structures, and problem-solving.

The exercises were developed during my studies and cover core Python concepts commonly required for junior developer roles.

## Repository Structure

- **basics/**
  - Variables, input/output
  - Conditionals (if / elif / else)
  - Loops (for / while)

- **collections/**
  - Lists
  - Tuples
  - Dictionaries
  - Sets
  - Collections module (Counter, defaultdict)

- **logic_practice/**
  - Logic exercises
  - Vectors and matrices
  - Problem-solving with loops and conditionals

## Goals

- Strengthen Python fundamentals
- Improve logical thinking through practice
- Write clear and readable code
- Build consistency before moving to frameworks

## Status

This repository is a **work in progress** and will be updated as I continue learning and practicing Python.
