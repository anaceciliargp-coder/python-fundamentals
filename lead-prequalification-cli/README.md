# Lead Pre-Qualification (CLI)

A simple command-line program that simulates lead pre-qualification logic for a car dealership.

The system collects user information, validates the input, confirms details, applies basic business rules, and classifies leads before sending them to a sales representative.

## Concepts practiced

- Functions
- Dictionaries
- Conditionals
- Loops
- `try / except` for basic input validation
- Simple business rules

## How to run

```bash
python main.py
```

## Rules (easy to change)

- `MINIMUM_AGE` (default: 19)
- `BASIC_INCOME_THRESHOLD` (default: 3000)
